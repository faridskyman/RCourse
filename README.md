# RCourse
This was initially suppose to be 'R Language Scripts did during course at ISS with sample data and other resources'
but the data was messy and i have not the time to organise, so for now its just my basic R scripts

I hope to add more regression and multi variable regression in the future, and get more info on the advance prediction analytics.
for now there are just 2.
